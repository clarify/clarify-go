This repository contains a Go(lang) SDK from [Clarify][clarify]. Clarify is a cloud service for active collaboration on time-series data. It includes a free plan to get started, a plan for small businesses as well as an Enterprise plan for our most demanding customers. If you are interested in SDKs for a different language, or perhaps a different way of integration altogether, please check our [documentation][docs].

## Risk of breaking changes

This SDK is following [Semantic Versioning][semver]. The SDK is currently in a v0 state, which means that we reserver the right to introduce breaking changes without increasing the MAJOR number.

## Features

This SDK is currently written for [Clarify API v1.1][docs-v1.1], and include the following features, based on your integration access configuration:

Always possible:

- Compose Clarify data frames using the `data` sub-package.
- Write signal meta-data to Clarify with `client.SaveSignals` (scoped to the current integration). See [examples/save_signals](examples/save_signals/).
- Write data frames to Clarify with `client.Insert` (scoped to the current integration). See [examples/insert](examples/insert/).

When access to the Admin namespace is granted in Clarify ` (scoped to entire organization):

- Read signal meta-data to Clarify with `client.Admin().SelectSignals`. Allows side-loading related items. See [examples/select_signals](examples/select_signals/).
- Publish signals as items directly with `client.Admin().PublishSignals`, or more conveniently via the `automation` package. See [examples/publish_signals](examples/publish_signals/) for the latter.

When access to the Clarify namespace is granted in Clarify (scoped to entire organization):

- Read item meta-data from Clarify via `client.Clarify().SelectItems`. See [examples/select_items](examples/select_items/).
- Read time-series data from Clarify via `client.Clarify().DataFrame`. See [examples/data_frame](examples/select_items/).
- Do calculations with data from Clarify via `client.Clarify().Evaluate`. See [examples/evaluate](examples/evaluate/).

## Setting up automation routines

By using our [automation](automation) and [automationcli](automation/automationcli) packages, you can quickly define a tree-structure of _Routines_ that can be recognized and run by path-name. See the [automation_cli](examples/automation_cli/) example, or fork our [automation template repository](https://github.com/clarify/template-clarify-automation) to get started. This template let's you customize and build your own automation CLI and easily run it inside GitHub Actions; no external hosting environment is required (unless you want to).
